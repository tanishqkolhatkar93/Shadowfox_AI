Developed an image tagging model using TensorFlow to classify images into categories such as cats and dogs.

Key Features:

Utilized the CIFAR-10 dataset for training and evaluation.
Achieved efficient image classification with deep learning techniques.
Built and optimized a CNN architecture for improved accuracy.
Technologies Used:

TensorFlow
Python
CIFAR-10 Dataset

### Task 2: Car Price Prediction
Description:
Designed a regression model to predict car prices based on various attributes such as mileage, year, and brand.

Key Features:

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for effective modeling.
Implemented a machine learning model to predict prices accurately.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Technologies Used:
